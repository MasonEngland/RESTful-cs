# RESTful-cs
A small project to practice making restful service in C#<br>

in this project I used entity framework and mysql for database integration<br>
and I used bcrypt.net for password encryption<br><br>
the purpose of this project was just to try out and learn how to make rest service using asp.net and
to connect those services to a front end built in react.<br><br>

nothing too crazy, just wanted more practice with .net and the C# language as a whole.
